        <p>Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver competing in Formula One, driving for Mercedes. In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the most number of wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among other records.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the inaugural McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren-Mercedes from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his debut season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. In 2008, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After a successful stint of six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.</p>
